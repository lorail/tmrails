			<em>ArtStream</em> is moderated and semi-exclusive. That is, the Administrator will remove pins at our discretion.  We don't publish, share or sell User's email addresses, although, we may send an email to a User related to <em>ArtStream</em>. Users may edit or delete their pinned images or descriptions at any time. <em>ArtStream</em> disclaims responsibility for rights or permissions, and Users pin with that understanding, accepting all responsibility. Images belong to the artists and should not be found elsewhere on the web without their permission and credit.

			Thank you for participating in this pilot project. Please use it to your advantage while creating a "quilt" of inspiration for others, as long as time. We plan to add User pages, links to social media, and more.
